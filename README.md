Analysis of historical data for the NBA basketball league from 1947 to 2025. The dataset contains detailed information about every player who has played in the American league. 
Data includes information about the player and, above all, advanced statistics and metrics that allow for the analysis of effectiveness, efficiency, consistency, and stability.

## Charts

First, the minutes played were analyzed. The first chart groups the years 1947-2025 into distinctive eras, such as the ABA merger era or the Jordan era, and shows how many minutes were allocated to each position on the court: PG, SG, SF, PF, C.

The second chart shows the minutes allocated to each age group, which allows us to see the total and relative amount of time given to young, middle-aged, and old players (in very simplified terms).

Staying with age, but moving away from minutes on the court, we can also analyze how the age structure has changed over time and obtain the top 10 most represented age groups in the league depending on the season.

Using filters for players, metrics, and seasons, you can compare any players from the period 1947-2020 against selected advanced metrics. Filtering seasons allows you to narrow down the comparison periodâ€”for example, to compare only their prime time or rookie years.
